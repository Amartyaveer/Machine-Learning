The data set used for this project is the Bezdek variation of the world famous Iris flower data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica and Iris-versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

# Methods:
* Data Extraction
* Data Exploration and Transformation
* Predictive Modelling
* Model Implementation

# Result
The output of the code is to predict the Irish flower species that wether it is Iris-virginica, Iris-setosa or Iris-versicolor on the basis of sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width.
